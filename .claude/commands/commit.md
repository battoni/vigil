# Commit

Stage and commit all current changes using conventional commits, grouped by concern, ordered bottom-up.

---

## Step 1 — Read the changes

Run the following in parallel:

- `git status` — list all tracked/untracked changed files
- `git diff` — see unstaged changes
- `git diff --cached` — see staged changes
- `git log --oneline -10` — recent commits for style reference

## Step 2 — Classify each file

For every changed file, assign:

- **Sub-project** — `api.vigil`, `app.vigil`, `cortex`, or root
- **Module** — the domain module (e.g. `Auth`, `User`, `Home`)
- **Layer** — the architectural layer, used for ordering:

| Priority | Layer (bottom-up) |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Enums, interfaces, types, constants |
| 2 | Migrations, models |
| 3 | DTOs |
| 4 | Repositories |
| 5 | Services |
| 6 | Requests, controllers, resources |
| 7 | Atoms |
| 8 | Molecules |
| 9 | Organisms |
| 10 | Templates, pages |
| 11 | Tests |
| 12 | Locale files, config, tooling |

## Step 3 — Group into commits

Group files that belong to the same logical concern. A concern is one of:

- A new model + migration + factory
- A service + its repository
- A controller + its request + DTO
- A component + its barrel export
- A test file + fixtures it needs
- Locale updates
- Config / tooling changes

**Rules:**

- Each commit touches **one concern** — never mix unrelated modules
- If a file bridges two concerns (e.g. a service calling both a new repo and a new model), include it in the commit where it is the primary change — not duplicated
- Barrel files (index.ts re-exports) go with the file they export
- When a single concern spans more sub-projects than one (e.g. API endpoint + frontend consumer), prefer separate commits per sub-project unless they are trivially small

## Step 4 — Order the commits

Sort the commit groups **bottom-up** using the layer priority table. Lower-numbered layers commit first.

Within the same layer, sort alphabetically by module name.

## Step 5 — Write commit messages

Use **conventional commits** format:

```
type(Scope): imperative description
```

### Type

| Type | When |
| --- | --- |
| `feat` | New functionality |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code change with no behaviour change |
| `chore` | Tooling, deps, config |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests only |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting, linting fixes (no logic change) |

### Scope

- Use the **module name** in PascalCase: `Auth`, `User`, `Home`
- For cross-module changes, use the sub-project: `api.vigil`, `app.vigil`, `cortex`
- For root-level changes: omit scope or use `monorepo`

### Subject line

- Imperative mood: `Add`, `Fix`, `Remove` — not `Added`, `Fixed`
- Under 72 characters
- No period at the end
- Describes the *what*, not the *how*

### Examples

```
feat(Auth): add LoginCredentialsDTO for the login flow
refactor(Auth): extract user lookup to UserRepository
fix(User): resolve role mapping in permission keys
test(Auth): add permission service unit tests
chore(app.vigil): sort locale files
```

## Step 6 — Present the plan

Output the commit plan as a numbered list:

```
1. feat(Auth): add LoginCredentialsDTO for the login flow
   - api.vigil/app/Modules/Auth/DTOs/LoginCredentialsDTO.php

2. refactor(Auth): extract user lookup to UserRepository
   - api.vigil/app/Modules/Auth/Repositories/UserRepository.php
   - api.vigil/app/Modules/Auth/Repositories/RoleRepository.php
```

**Do not commit yet.** Wait for approval.

## Step 7 — Execute (after approval)

For each commit in order:

1. `git add <files>`
2. `git commit -m "<message>"`
3. Verify with `git status` that no files were missed

After all commits, run `git log --oneline -<N>` (where N = number of commits made) to confirm the result.

## Rules

- NEVER add an AI authorship signature — no `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` trailer, no "Generated with Claude Code" line. Commits read as the developer's own work.
- NEVER update git config
- NEVER use `--amend` unless the user explicitly asks
- NEVER push — that is a separate command (`/publish-pr`)
- If a pre-commit hook modifies files, stage the modifications and amend the commit (only this case)
- If a commit fails due to a hook, fix the issue and create a NEW commit — do not amend
- Do not commit files that contain secrets (`.env`, credentials, tokens)
- Do not create empty commits
