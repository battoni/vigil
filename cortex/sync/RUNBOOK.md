# Cortex Sync — Runbook

**Status: verified (2026-06-02).** Covers the engine that ships today — B2a (MERGE engine),
B2b (source-green gate), B2c (triage), and B3 (`--init` first-run + `/setup-project`). Every
step below is exercised end-to-end by `make sync-test-engine`, `make sync-test`,
`make sync-test-init`, and `make sync-audit`, all green.

How to propagate pendulum's improvements into a downstream project (zion, impressao, …)
without clobbering that project's local changes. Read `DESIGN.md` for the *why*; this is the
*do*. All commands run from the **pendulum** repo unless noted.

---

## Mental model (30 seconds)

- Pendulum is the source of truth. Each file has a **MODE** in `manifest.tsv`:
  `OVERWRITE` (AI layer — written straight to the project), `MERGE` (code/tests/config — goes
  through a vendor branch + `git merge`), `LOCAL` (project owns it — never touched), `SKIP`.
- The MERGE half uses a per-project **`pendulum-upstream`** vendor branch: the engine
  regenerates it to hold pendulum's MERGE files, name-mapped to the project, and **stops**.
  You run `git merge pendulum-upstream` — git does the 3-way merge; conflicts surface only
  where both sides changed the same lines.
- Two safety nets: **git** catches *textual* loss; the **test suite** (run post-merge) catches
  *behavioral* breaks. Green + clean merge = safe.

---

## Commands

```bash
# from the pendulum repo
python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --audit                 # verify the manifest classifies every file
python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --triage --to ../zion   # preview: what changed per unit, how hard to look
python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --to ../zion --dry-run  # show the sync plan; write nothing
python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --to ../zion            # apply (prompts) — OVERWRITE + regenerate vendor branch
python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --to ../zion --yes      # apply without the prompt
python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --to ../zion --force    # apply, skipping the source-green CI gate
python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --resolve-t0 --to ../zion  # auto-resolve the T0 merge by mode (after `git merge`)
```

Make targets (pendulum-side checks): `make sync-audit`, `make sync-test`, `make sync-test-engine`,
`make sync-test-init`.

## Per-project setup (once)

The project repo needs `.cortex-sync.conf` at its root:

```
PROJECT=zion
APP=app.zion
API=api.zion
```

`.cortex-version` (the last pendulum SHA synced) is created/advanced by you at the end of each
sync — see below. Both are `SKIP`/`LOCAL`, never propagated.

> **First-run rename is automated.** Right after cloning pendulum and `git init`-ing the new
> repo, run `/setup-project` — it writes `.cortex-sync.conf`, then calls
> `python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --init` to rename `celer`→`app.<project>` / `arcus`→`api.<project>`
> in place (rule filename tokens like `celer-*` preserved; refuses to run on pendulum itself).
> You then delete unused modules and make the initial commit. T0 below ties that initial commit
> to pendulum's history as the merge base.

---

## T0 — establish the baseline (once per project)

Run while divergence is still brand-only (the cheap moment). This ties the two histories so
later merges have a real base.

```bash
# 1. In the project repo, confirm .cortex-sync.conf exists (above) and the tree is clean.

# 2. From pendulum, run the sync. It writes OVERWRITE files to the project worktree and
#    creates the orphan `pendulum-upstream` branch holding the transformed MERGE set.
python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --to ../zion --yes

# 3. In the project repo: commit the OVERWRITE layer, then merge the vendor branch in.
cd ../zion
git add -A && git commit -m "cortex T0: overwrite layer"
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories pendulum-upstream

# 4. Auto-resolve the T0 conflicts by mode (one command — see recipe below), then run the suite.
python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --resolve-t0 --to ../zion   # or --dry-run first to preview
cd ../zion && git commit --no-edit                       # the resolver stages; you commit
make test-all                                            # the behavioral gate

# 5. Only after green: record the synced pendulum SHA.
echo <pendulum-sha> > .cortex-version
git add .cortex-version && git commit -m "cortex T0: baseline at <pendulum-sha>"
```

The merge commit in step 3 is what gives git a real merge base from here on.

### What `--resolve-t0` does

T0 is **not** near-empty for an already-diverged project: the empty merge base makes every
MERGE file that differs on both sides a "both added" conflict (~90 on zion). They are
mechanical, not judgement calls, so `--resolve-t0` settles them all by the file's **MODE**:

| Conflicted file's mode | Resolved to | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MERGE` (code/tests/config) | **upstream** (theirs) | T0 adopts pendulum's version; the project's pre-metadata edits are reconciled here once |
| `OVERWRITE` / `LOCAL` | **project** (ours) | the AI layer is already current (step 3); locks/brand/`.env` are the project's |
| `package.json` / `composer.json` | **union** | upstream base (it carries the test toolchain) + any project-only deps added back |

Files only the project has (its own feature modules, planning docs) are kept automatically (adds,
not conflicts). The resolver **stages** the result and stops — you run the suite, then commit.
Validated on zion: 89 conflicts → 0 unresolved in one command (87 upstream, 2 union).

> **T0 only.** `--resolve-t0` takes upstream for *every* MERGE conflict, which is right only at
> the baseline (the project hasn't intentionally forked code yet). At `Tn` a MERGE conflict means
> both sides edited the same lines — an intentional-divergence judgement call you resolve by hand
> (see below). After T0, `Tn` merges are clean anyway: the T0 merge commit is the shared base, so
> only genuine both-sides edits conflict.

---

## Tn — every later pendulum update

```bash
# 1. Preview. Diverged units need the closest look; clean-update units fast-forward.
python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --triage --to ../zion

# 2. Apply. The source-green gate runs first: it checks pendulum's own CI for the SHA
#    being synced and REFUSES if it isn't green. OVERWRITE files then land in the
#    worktree; `pendulum-upstream` is regenerated and committed. The engine then STOPS.
python3 cortex/sync/sync.py --to ../zion --yes
#    Commit local first? Then `git push` so CI can run — or pass --force to sync from an
#    unpushed commit you trust (see "The source-green gate" below).

# 4. In the project repo, merge the vendor branch. Conflicts surface only where the project
#    edited the same lines pendulum did.
cd ../zion
git merge pendulum-upstream

# 5. Resolve conflicts (see "intentional divergence" below), then run the suite.
make test-all

# 6. Only after green: advance the marker.
echo <pendulum-sha> > .cortex-version
git add .cortex-version && git commit -m "cortex: sync to <pendulum-sha>"
```

`sync.py` prints these next-steps after it runs, so you don't have to memorise them.

## Reading the triage dashboard

`--triage` compares each unit's pendulum `version` against the project's `based-on`:

| State | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unchanged` | project is at pendulum's version | skip |
| `clean-update` | pendulum moved; project never edited this unit | git fast-forwards — low risk |
| `diverged` | both pendulum and the project edited this unit | review the merge carefully |
| `project-ahead` | project edited locally; pendulum has nothing new | nothing to merge |
| `new` | pendulum has a unit the project lacks | additive |

The severity flag (`‼` major / `+` minor / `·` patch) grades pendulum's delta. Each actionable
row prints the unit's **CHANGELOG entries since `based-on`**, so you read *what* changed without
diffing.

---

## The source-green gate (B2b)

Before a real sync, `sync.py` checks **pendulum's own CI** for the SHA it's about to
propagate, and refuses to sync from a source that isn't green. This stops a broken
pendulum commit from fanning out to every downstream project.

| Gate state | Meaning | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GREEN` | all checks passed | sync proceeds |
| `RED` | a check failed | **blocked** — fix CI first (or `--force`) |
| `PENDING` | checks still running | **blocked** — wait for CI (or `--force`) |
| `NO_CHECKS` | the commit has no CI configured | **blocked** (or `--force`) |
| `UNPUSHED` | the commit isn't on the remote yet | **blocked** — `git push` first (or `--force`) |
| `UNKNOWN` | no `gh` / no remote — can't verify | **blocked** (or `--force`) |

- The gate reads the source repo via `gh` (combined commit status + check-runs). It needs
  `gh` installed and authenticated.
- **`--force`** skips the gate entirely (and its network call) — the escape hatch for an
  unpushed local commit you trust, or a repo with no CI. `--dry-run` reports the gate state
  but never blocks (a dry run writes nothing).
- The decision logic is pure and unit-tested (`make sync-test`); the block behaviour is
  proven hermetically in `make sync-test-engine`.

---

## Intentional divergence (important)

A project that deliberately forked a unit's behavior will see pendulum's merged-in **test** fail
against it. **That is the correct signal**, not a bug — the test layer is a *behavioral*
conflict-surfacer complementing git's textual one. When it happens:

- **Adapt the project's copy** (its own version, bumped above `based-on`), or
- **Accept the divergence** and keep the fork.
- **Never** "fix" an intentional fork back to pendulum just because a test went red.

`clean merge + green tests` = safe. `clean merge + red tests` = a real behavioral break to
investigate before advancing `.cortex-version`.

---

## Guarantees & non-guarantees

- The engine **never** writes to pendulum, and never touches `LOCAL`/`SKIP` files in the project.
- **Sub-project scoping.** `celer`/`arcus` are core and always sync (they are the project's
  app/api). Pendulum's optional siblings (`codelumen`, `liquen`, `vitrum`) sync **only if the
  target already has that directory** — a project that deleted one at bootstrap won't have it
  forced back. The sync report prints how many files were skipped for opted-out sub-projects.
- **Brand / visual identity is `LOCAL` and never overwritten.** `colors.css` (the brand
  contract), `src/components/atoms/ALogo/`, `src/assets/logo/`, `public/favicon/`, and
  `index.html` are project-owned — the sync leaves them untouched. Verify with `--audit`.
- **Brand *content* inside shared files is reconciled, not protected.** Identity *strings* that
  live inside a MERGE file (e.g. a personalized login welcome in `locales/*.json`) can't be
  file-classified. At T0 they revert to pendulum's neutral text and surface in the divergence /
  triage output — **re-apply your wording from there** (the accepted approach; no auto-machinery).
  Keep such strings brand-neutral in pendulum so a revert is harmless, never a wrong-brand leak.
- It writes OVERWRITE directly and stages MERGE on the vendor branch — it **stops before the
  merge**; the merge and conflict resolution are yours (human judgment).
- It does **not** advance `.cortex-version` — you do, only after green tests.
- Dependency lock files (`composer.lock`, `package-lock.json`, …) are `LOCAL`: each project owns
  its own; regenerate with `npm install` / `composer install` after a sync if dependencies moved.

## Status of the build

The sync engine is feature-complete for the designed scope:

- **[B2a]** MERGE engine (vendor branch + `git merge`) — `make sync-test-engine`.
- **[B2b]** Source-green gate (`gh` CI check; `--force` override) — `make sync-test` (logic) +
  `make sync-test-engine` (block behaviour).
- **[B2c]** Triage dashboard — `make sync-test-engine`.
- **[B3]** `/setup-project` → `sync.py --init` first-run rename — `make sync-test-init`.

Pendulum's own suites are green at the synced SHA (celer unit/integration 117, celer e2e 24,
arcus Pest 72), so the source-green gate has a real green signal to gate on once commits are
pushed and CI runs.

Future ideas (not scoped): a `--merge` convenience that runs the git merge for you, and
auto-advancing `.cortex-version` after a verified-green merge.
